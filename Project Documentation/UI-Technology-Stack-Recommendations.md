   - Easy integration with ML/AI components
   - Strong type hints and validation

### Frontend Options:

1. React + TypeScript (Recommended)
   - Advantages:
     - Component-based architecture
     - Strong typing with TypeScript
     - Large ecosystem of libraries
     - Good for complex document interactions
     - Easy integration with FastAPI backend
   - Key Libraries:
     - react-dropzone (file uploads)
     - react-query (data fetching)
     - tailwindcss (styling)
     - react-pdf (document preview)

2. Streamlit (Alternative for Quick Development)
   - Advantages:
     - Python-native
     - Rapid prototyping
     - Built-in ML/AI visualization
