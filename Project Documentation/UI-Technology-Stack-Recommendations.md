# UI Technology Stack Recommendations

## System Overview
This document management system provides robust document handling with type classification, versioning, and metadata management capabilities.

## Recommended Stack

### Primary Backend: FastAPI
1. Advantages:
   - Modern, fast Python web framework
   - Built-in API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Async support for better performance
   - Easy integration with ML/AI components
   - Strong type hints and validation
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. Core Services:
   - Document management with versioning
   - Document type classification
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Metadata tracking and search
   - Content hash verification

### Frontend Options:

1. React + TypeScript (Recommended)
   - Advantages:
     - Component-based architecture
     - Strong typing with TypeScript
     - Large ecosystem of libraries
     - Good for complex document interactions
     - Easy integration with FastAPI backend
   - Key Libraries:
     - react-dropzone (file uploads)
     - react-query (data fetching)
     - tailwindcss (styling)
     - react-pdf (document preview)
     - @tanstack/react-table (metadata display)

2. Streamlit (Alternative for Quick Development)
   - Advantages:
     - Python-native
     - Rapid prototyping
     - Built-in ML/AI visualization
     - Minimal frontend expertise required
   - Best for:
     - Initial prototyping
     - Data science focused interfaces
     - Quick iteration cycles

### Supporting Technologies:

1. Authentication & Security:
   - Python-JOSE for JWT
   - Passlib with bcrypt for password hashing
   - Role-based access control

2. File Handling:
   - python-multipart for file uploads
   - aiofiles for async file operations
   - SHA-256 for content verification
   - Structured storage organization

3. Database Architecture:
   - SQLAlchemy for ORM
   - Alembic for migrations
   - SQL Server backend
   - Comprehensive data models for:
     - User management
     - Document tracking
     - Type classification
     - Metadata storage
     - Version control

4. Document Processing:
   - PyPDF2 for PDF handling
   - python-docx for Word documents
   - Tesseract for OCR capabilities
   - Custom schema validation

## Deployment Considerations:
- Docker containers for consistency
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- Redis for caching
- MinIO for document storage
- Logging and monitoring setup
- Regular backup procedures

## Development Practices:
- Comprehensive code documentation
- Type hinting throughout
- Error handling standards
- Transaction management
- Soft deletion pattern
- Audit trail maintenance
